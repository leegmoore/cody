===== PHASE 2.1: UX REFINEMENT & CONFIG LOADING =====

ROLE: Senior TypeScript developer fixing critical UX and configuration bugs in Cody CLI discovered during Phase 2 testing.

PRODUCT: Cody CLI - multi-provider LLM agent with tool execution

ISSUES TO FIX:

1. Config loading incomplete - only reads provider/auth, ignores approval_policy and other settings
2. Duplicate tool display - shown in both approval.ts and display.ts  
3. Verbose submission logging - dumps full object every turn
4. Path references - update ~/.codex to ~/.cody in comments/messages

TASKS:

1. Add config normalization functions (normalizeApprovalPolicy, normalizeSandboxMode, normalizeReasoningEffort)
2. Update loadCliConfig() in cli/config.ts to apply ALL config settings from toml file
3. Remove duplicate tool display from approval.ts lines 10-11
4. Remove/quiet submission logging in submission-loop.ts line 27
5. Update all ~/.codex references to ~/.cody

TEST with ~/.cody/config.toml containing approval_policy="never" - tools should execute without prompts.

VERIFICATION: Clean output (<200 lines), no duplicates, config respected, no timeouts.

See phase-2.1/source/design.md for complete details.
