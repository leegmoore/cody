# CURRENT.md - Active Slice

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25

## Slice: Complete Process Foundation

### The ONE Thing
Finish refining process docs and tools so we can use them for real work.

### Done When
- [x] STATE.md - ground truth (stable)
- [x] PROCESS.md - workflow/checkpoints (stable)
- [x] CURRENT.md - active focus (this file)
- [x] NEXT.md - work queue (created)
- [x] CLAUDE.md - references all docs
- [x] TOOLS.md - designs sketched
- [x] templates/ - SPEC, PROMPT, LARGE-FEATURE
- [x] Beads documented in PROCESS.md
- [x] Context checkpoints defined
- [ ] Slash commands created in `.claude/commands/`
- [ ] Beads initialized in cody-fastify
- [ ] Process tested on real slice (test infrastructure recovery)

### NOT Touching
- Test infrastructure code (next slice)
- UI code
- Feature work

### Integration Points
- CLAUDE.md → references all process docs
- PLANNER-INIT.md → instructs to read STATE.md, PROCESS.md
- NEXT.md → tracks work queue separately
