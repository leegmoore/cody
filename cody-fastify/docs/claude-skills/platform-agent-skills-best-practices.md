Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that Claude can discover and use effectively.

For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the [Skills overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The [context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else Claude needs to know, including:

- The system prompt
- Conversation history
- Other Skills' metadata
- Your actual request

Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Claude reads SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and reads additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once Claude loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context.

**Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart

Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information:

- "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
- "Can I assume Claude knows this?"
- "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good example: Concise** (approximately 50 tokens):

````markdown
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
````

**Bad example: Too verbose** (approximately 150 tokens):

```markdown
## Extract PDF text

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains
text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to
use a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we
recommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well.
First, you'll need to install it using pip. Then you can use the code below...
```

The concise version assumes Claude knows what PDFs are and how libraries work.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability.

**High freedom** (text-based instructions):

Use when:
- Multiple approaches are valid
- Decisions depend on context
- Heuristics guide the approach

Example:

```markdown
## Code review process

1. Analyze the code structure and organization
2. Check for potential bugs or edge cases
3. Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
4. Verify adherence to project conventions
```

**Medium freedom** (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):

Use when:
- A preferred pattern exists
- Some variation is acceptable
- Configuration affects behavior

Example:

````markdown
## Generate report

Use this template and customize as needed:

```python
def generate_report(data, format="markdown", include_charts=True):
    # Process data
    # Generate output in specified format
    # Optionally include visualizations
```
````

**Low freedom** (specific scripts, few or no parameters):

Use when:
- Operations are fragile and error-prone
- Consistency is critical
- A specific sequence must be followed

Example:

````markdown
## Database migration

Run exactly this script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup
```

Do not modify the command or add additional flags.
````

**Analogy**: Think of Claude as a robot exploring a path:

- **Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides**: There's only one safe way forward. Provide specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom). Example: database migrations that must run in exact sequence.
- **Open field with no hazards**: Many paths lead to success. Give general direction and trust Claude to find the best route (high freedom). Example: code reviews where context determines the best approach.

### Test with All Models You Plan to Use

Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with.

**Testing considerations by model**:

- **Claude Haiku** (fast, economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
- **Claude Sonnet** (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient?
- **Claude Opus** (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?

What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them.

## Skill Structure

**YAML Frontmatter**: The SKILL.md frontmatter requires two fields:

`name`:

- Maximum 64 characters
- Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Cannot contain XML tags
- Cannot contain reserved words: "anthropic", "claude"

`description`:

- Must be non-empty
- Maximum 1024 characters
- Cannot contain XML tags
- Should describe what the Skill does and when to use it

For complete Skill structure details, see the [Skills overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure).

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We recommend using **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the activity or capability the Skill provides.

Remember that the `name` field must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

**Good naming examples (gerund form)**:

- `processing-pdfs`
- `analyzing-spreadsheets`
- `managing-databases`
- `testing-code`
- `writing-documentation`

**Acceptable alternatives**:

- Noun phrases: `pdf-processing`, `spreadsheet-analysis`
- Action-oriented: `process-pdfs`, `analyze-spreadsheets`

**Avoid**:

- Vague names: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`
- Overly generic: `documents`, `data`, `files`
- Reserved words: `anthropic-helper`, `claude-tools`
- Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection

Consistent naming makes it easier to:

- Reference Skills in documentation and conversations
- Understand what a Skill does at a glance
- Organize and search through multiple Skills
- Maintain a professional, cohesive skill library

### Writing Effective Descriptions

The `description` field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it.

**Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.

- **Good:** "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
- **Avoid:** "I can help you process Excel files"
- **Avoid:** "You can use this to process Excel files"

**Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

Each Skill has exactly one description field. The description is critical for skill selection: Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills. Your description must provide enough detail for Claude to know when to select this Skill, while the rest of SKILL.md provides the implementation details.

Effective examples:

**PDF Processing skill:**

```markdown
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Excel Analysis skill:**

```markdown
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.
```

**Git Commit Helper skill:**

```markdown
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

Avoid vague descriptions like these:

```markdown
description: Helps with documents
```

```markdown
description: Processes data
```

```markdown
description: Does stuff with files
```

### Progressive Disclosure Patterns

SKILL.md serves as an overview that points Claude to detailed materials as needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide. For an explanation of how progressive disclosure works, see [How Skills work](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the overview.

**Practical guidance:**

- Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
- Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively

#### Visual overview: From simple to complex

A basic Skill starts with just a SKILL.md file containing metadata and instructions:

![Simple SKILL.md file](https://platform.claude.com/docs/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png)

As your Skill grows, you can bundle additional content that Claude loads only when needed:

![Bundling additional reference files](https://platform.claude.com/docs/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png)

The complete Skill directory structure might look like this:

```
pdf/
├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions (loaded when triggered)
├── FORMS.md              # Form-filling guide (loaded as needed)
├── reference.md          # API reference (loaded as needed)
├── examples.md           # Usage examples (loaded as needed)
└── scripts/
    ├── analyze_form.py   # Utility script (executed, not loaded)
    ├── fill_form.py      # Form filling script
    └── validate.py       # Validation script
```

#### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

````markdown
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

## Advanced features

**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
**Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
````

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

#### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context. When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only needs to read sales-related schemas, not finance or marketing data. This keeps token usage low and context focused.

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

**SKILL.md:**

````markdown
# BigQuery Data Analysis

## Available datasets

**Finance**: Revenue, ARR, billing → See [reference/finance.md](reference/finance.md)
**Sales**: Opportunities, pipeline, accounts → See [reference/sales.md](reference/sales.md)
**Product**: API usage, features, adoption → See [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
**Marketing**: Campaigns, attribution, email → See [reference/marketing.md](reference/marketing.md)

## Quick search

Find specific metrics using grep:

```bash
grep -i "revenue" reference/finance.md
grep -i "pipeline" reference/sales.md
grep -i "api usage" reference/product.md
```
````

#### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.

### Avoid Deeply Nested References

Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files. When encountering nested references, Claude might use commands like `head -100` to preview content rather than reading entire files, resulting in incomplete information.

**Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md**. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md to ensure Claude reads complete files when needed.

**Bad example: Too deep**:

```markdown
# SKILL.md
See [advanced.md](advanced.md)...

# advanced.md
See [details.md](details.md)...

# details.md
Here's the actual information...
```

**Good example: One level deep**:

```markdown
# SKILL.md

**Basic usage**: [instructions in SKILL.md]
**Advanced features**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
**API reference**: See [reference.md](reference.md)
**Examples**: See [examples.md](examples.md)
```

### Structure Longer Reference Files with Table of Contents

For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top. This ensures Claude can see the full scope of available information even when previewing with partial reads.

**Example**:

```markdown
# API Reference

## Contents
- Authentication and setup
- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)
- Advanced features (batch operations, webhooks)
- Error handling patterns
- Code examples

## Authentication and setup
...

## Core methods
...
```

Claude can then read the complete file or jump to specific sections as needed.

## Workflows and Feedback Loops

### Use Workflows for Complex Tasks

Break complex operations into clear, sequential steps. For particularly complex workflows, provide a checklist that Claude can copy into its response and check off as it progresses.

**Example 1: Research synthesis workflow** (for Skills without code):

````markdown
## Research synthesis workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Research Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read all source documents
- [ ] Step 2: Identify key themes
- [ ] Step 3: Cross-reference claims
- [ ] Step 4: Create structured summary
- [ ] Step 5: Verify citations
```

**Step 1: Read all source documents**

Review each document in the `sources/` directory. Note the main arguments and supporting evidence.

**Step 2: Identify key themes**

Look for patterns across sources. What themes appear repeatedly? Where do sources agree or disagree?

[... detailed steps ...]
````

### Implement Feedback Loops

**Common pattern**: Run validator → fix errors → repeat

This pattern greatly improves output quality.

**Example: Document editing process** (for Skills with code):

```markdown
## Document editing process

1. Make your edits to `word/document.xml`
2. **Validate immediately**: `python ooxml/scripts/validate.py unpacked_dir/`
3. If validation fails:
   - Review the error message carefully
   - Fix the issues in the XML
   - Run validation again
4. **Only proceed when validation passes**
5. Rebuild: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked_dir/ output.docx`
6. Test the output document
```

The validation loop catches errors early.

## Content Guidelines

### Avoid Time-Sensitive Information

Don't include information that will become outdated:

**Bad example: Time-sensitive** (will become wrong):

```markdown
If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.
After August 2025, use the new API.
```

**Good example** (use "old patterns" section):

```markdown
## Current method

Use the v2 API endpoint: `api.example.com/v2/messages`

## Old patterns

<details>
<summary>Legacy v1 API (deprecated 2025-08)</summary>

The v1 API used: `api.example.com/v1/messages`

This endpoint is no longer supported.
</details>
```

### Use Consistent Terminology

Choose one term and use it throughout the Skill:

**Good - Consistent**:

- Always "API endpoint"
- Always "field"
- Always "extract"

**Bad - Inconsistent**:

- Mix "API endpoint", "URL", "API route", "path"
- Mix "field", "box", "element", "control"
- Mix "extract", "pull", "get", "retrieve"

Consistency helps Claude understand and follow instructions.

## Common Patterns

### Template Pattern

Provide templates for output format. Match the level of strictness to your needs.

**For strict requirements** (like API responses or data formats):

````markdown
## Report structure

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data
- Finding 3 with supporting data

## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
```
````

**For flexible guidance** (when adaptation is useful):

````markdown
## Report structure

Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment based on the analysis:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[Overview]

## Key findings
[Adapt sections based on what you discover]

## Recommendations
[Tailor to the specific context]
```

Adjust sections as needed for the specific analysis type.
````

### Examples Pattern

For Skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs:

````markdown
## Commit message format

Generate commit messages following these examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware
```

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports
Output:
```
fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation
```
````

### Conditional Workflow Pattern

Guide Claude through decision points:

```markdown
## Document modification workflow

1. Determine the modification type:

   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow:
   - Use docx-js library
   - Build document from scratch
   - Export to .docx format

3. Editing workflow:
   - Unpack existing document
   - Modify XML directly
   - Validate after each change
   - Repack when complete
```

## Evaluation and Iteration

### Build Evaluations First

**Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation.** This ensures your Skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

**Evaluation-driven development:**

1. **Identify gaps**: Run Claude on representative tasks without a Skill. Document specific failures or missing context
2. **Create evaluations**: Build three scenarios that test these gaps
3. **Establish baseline**: Measure Claude's performance without the Skill
4. **Write minimal instructions**: Create just enough content to address the gaps and pass evaluations
5. **Iterate**: Execute evaluations, compare against baseline, and refine

### Develop Skills Iteratively with Claude

The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself. Work with one instance of Claude ("Claude A") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances ("Claude B").

**Creating a new Skill:**

1. **Complete a task without a Skill**: Work through a problem with Claude A using normal prompting
2. **Identify the reusable pattern**: After completing the task, identify what context you provided that would be useful for similar future tasks
3. **Ask Claude A to create a Skill**: "Create a Skill that captures this BigQuery analysis pattern we just used"
4. **Review for conciseness**: Check that Claude A hasn't added unnecessary explanations
5. **Test on similar tasks**: Use the Skill with Claude B (a fresh instance) on related use cases
6. **Iterate based on observation**: If Claude B struggles, return to Claude A with specifics

## Advanced: Skills with Executable Code

### Solve, Don't Punt

When writing scripts for Skills, handle error conditions rather than punting to Claude.

**Good example: Handle errors explicitly**:

```python
def process_file(path):
    """Process a file, creating it if it doesn't exist."""
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Create file with default content instead of failing
        print(f"File {path} not found, creating default")
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            f.write('')
        return ''
```

### Provide Utility Scripts

Pre-made scripts offer advantages over Claude generating code:

**Benefits of utility scripts**:

- More reliable than generated code
- Save tokens (no need to include code in context)
- Save time (no code generation required)
- Ensure consistency across uses

### Use Visual Analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them:

````markdown
## Form layout analysis

1. Convert PDF to images:
   ```bash
   python scripts/pdf_to_images.py form.pdf
   ```

2. Analyze each page image to identify form fields
3. Claude can see field locations and types visually
````

### MCP Tool References

If your Skill uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, always use fully qualified tool names:

**Format**: `ServerName:tool_name`

**Example**:

```markdown
Use the BigQuery:bigquery_schema tool to retrieve table schemas.
Use the GitHub:create_issue tool to create issues.
```
