This tutorial shows you how to use Agent Skills to create a PowerPoint presentation. You'll learn how to enable Skills, make a simple request, and access the generated file.

## Prerequisites

- [Anthropic API key](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys)
- Python 3.7+ or curl installed
- Basic familiarity with making API requests

## What are Agent Skills?

Pre-built Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized expertise for tasks like creating documents, analyzing data, and processing files. Anthropic provides the following pre-built Agent Skills in the API:

- **PowerPoint (pptx)**: Create and edit presentations
- **Excel (xlsx)**: Create and analyze spreadsheets
- **Word (docx)**: Create and edit documents
- **PDF (pdf)**: Generate PDF documents

**Want to create custom Skills?** See the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills) for examples of building your own Skills with domain-specific expertise.

## Step 1: List Available Skills

First, let's see what Skills are available. We'll use the Skills API to list all Anthropic-managed Skills:

**Python:**

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# List Anthropic-managed Skills
skills = client.beta.skills.list(
    source="anthropic",
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]
)

for skill in skills.data:
    print(f"{skill.id}: {skill.display_title}")
```

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic();

const skills = await client.beta.skills.list({
  source: 'anthropic',
  betas: ['skills-2025-10-02']
});

for (const skill of skills.data) {
  console.log(`${skill.id}: ${skill.display_title}`);
}
```

**Shell:**

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02" \
  -d '{"source": "anthropic"}'
```

You see the following Skills: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pdf`.

This API returns each Skill's metadata: its name and description. Claude loads this metadata at startup to know what Skills are available. This is the first level of **progressive disclosure**, where Claude discovers Skills without loading their full instructions yet.

## Step 2: Create a Presentation

Now we'll use the PowerPoint Skill to create a presentation about renewable energy. We specify Skills using the `container` parameter in the Messages API:

**Python:**

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [
            {
                "type": "anthropic",
                "skill_id": "pptx",
                "version": "latest"
            }
        ]
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides"
    }],
    tools=[{
        "type": "code_execution_20250825",
        "name": "code_execution"
    }]
)

print(response.content)
```

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
const response = await client.beta.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  betas: ['code-execution-2025-08-25', 'skills-2025-10-02'],
  container: {
    skills: [
      {
        type: 'anthropic',
        skill_id: 'pptx',
        version: 'latest'
      }
    ]
  },
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides'
  }],
  tools: [{
    type: 'code_execution_20250825',
    name: 'code_execution'
  }]
});
```

Let's break down what each part does:

- **`container.skills`**: Specifies which Skills Claude can use
- **`type: "anthropic"`**: Indicates this is an Anthropic-managed Skill
- **`skill_id: "pptx"`**: The PowerPoint Skill identifier
- **`version: "latest"`**: The Skill version set to the most recently published
- **`tools`**: Enables code execution (required for Skills)
- **Beta headers**: `code-execution-2025-08-25` and `skills-2025-10-02`

When you make this request, Claude automatically matches your task to the relevant Skill. Since you asked for a presentation, Claude determines the PowerPoint Skill is relevant and loads its full instructions: the second level of progressive disclosure. Then Claude executes the Skill's code to create your presentation.

## Step 3: Download the Created File

The presentation was created in the code execution container and saved as a file. The response includes a file reference with a file ID. Extract the file ID and download it using the Files API:

**Python:**

```python
# Extract file ID from response
file_id = None
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == 'tool_use' and block.name == 'code_execution':
        # File ID is in the tool result
        for result_block in block.content:
            if hasattr(result_block, 'file_id'):
                file_id = result_block.file_id
                break

if file_id:
    # Download the file
    file_content = client.beta.files.download(
        file_id=file_id,
        betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]
    )

    # Save to disk
    with open("renewable_energy.pptx", "wb") as f:
        file_content.write_to_file(f.name)

    print(f"Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx")
```

For complete details on working with generated files, see the [code execution tool documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#retrieve-generated-files).
